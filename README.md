Little terminal game in c/c++. (for fun)
- Run's on Ubuntu 24.04.
- clone and run as so `g++ main.cpp world.cpp move.cpp item.cpp -lcurses -pthread && ./a.out`
- I moves up
- J moves left
- K moved down
- L moves right

Move the player to the changing numbers as fast as you can. 
Based on what value the number is on when you hover over it determines the amount of points you receive.
There are 5 levels. The time is ticking on each one.
